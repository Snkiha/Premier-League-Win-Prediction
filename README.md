# Premier League Win Predictor
- A machine learning project that uses Logistic Regression to predict the outcome of English Premier League matches. By analyzing historical match data and team form, this model estimates the probability of a home win, away win, or draw.

# Project Overview
- Predicting football results is notoriously difficult due to the "any given Sunday" nature of the sport. This project applies a binary and multinomial Logistic Regression framework to quantify the influence of home advantage, recent form, and team strength on the final whistle.
